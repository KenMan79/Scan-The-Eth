# Scan-The-Eth

This project is a simple demonstration of [etherscan](https://etherscan.io) dashboard.


This project used the [etherscan api](https://etherscan.io/apis) to get the ethereum blockchain data.

For the UI part, instead of basic html and css, we have used the fantastic [semantic-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) library.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## App Setup

1. Create an account in the etherscan and create an api-key token.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Create an `.env` file in the `src` folder and copy paste the `.env.example` content.
5. Replace the `"ETHERSCAN API KEY"` text with your api key.
6. Run `npm start` to start the application on `localhost:3000`.

## Warning

The free api has a limit of 5 request per sec/ip. When the application was created the request cap was high.

This app is not updated for this limit.

You can create a buffer of 1-2 second in between calls to make it work.
